## 🏦 Bank Churn Prediction – Deep Learning Model

🚀 Project Overview
This project predicts customer churn using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow & Keras. It analyzes customer data, applies feature engineering, and trains a neural network to classify whether a customer is likely to leave the bank.

🔥 Key Features
✔️ Data preprocessing & feature scaling

✔️ Label encoding for categorical features (Geography, Gender)

✔️ Neural Network (Dense layers with ReLU & Sigmoid activations)

✔️ Model training & evaluation with accuracy metrics

✔️ Saves trained model using Pickle for deployment

🛠️ Tech Stack
🔹 Python

🔹 Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)

🔹 TensorFlow, Keras (Deep Learning)

🔹 Scikit-learn (Preprocessing & Model Evaluation)
